*NOTE* - this has exists in 2.7.x core, it has been published seperately
so that it can be used with 2.6.x

This module contains a custom function for puppet that can be used to dynamically add resources to the catalog.

I wrote this to use with an external node classifier that consumes YAML.

The yaml specifies classes and passes hashes to those classes as parameters

classes:
  webserver::instances:
    instances:
      instance1:
        foo: bar
      instance2:
        foo: blah

Then puppet code can consume the hash parameters and convert then into resources

class webserver::instances (
  $instances = {}
) {
  create_resources('webserver::instance', $instances)
}

Now I can dynamically determine how webserver instances are deployed to nodes
by updating the YAML files.
